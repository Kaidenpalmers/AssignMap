## What is AssignMap?
AssignMap , Assignment + guidMap, is an AI-powered assignment subtask and rubric generator designed to enhance the educational experience by helping students and teachers efficiently manage their assignments. Leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's API, AssignMap generates detailed subtasks and rubrics tailored to specific assignment requirements. By integrating tracks of social good and artificial intelligence, AssignMap aims to provide quality educational tools that promote efficient learning and teaching.

## Why did we create AssignMap?
In today's fast-paced educational environment, students often struggle with managing multiple assignments and understanding their requirements. AssignMap addresses these challenges by:

- Enhancing Task Management: Break down assignments into manageable subtasks.
- Providing Clear Guidelines: Generate rubrics that clarify assessment criteria.
- Supporting Diverse Learning Styles: Help students organize their work in a way that suits their learning preferences.
